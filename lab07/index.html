        Hello my name is Ford Lenchner, I am a student majoring in Information Management at Syracuse University's Ischool. I am exploring the exciting world of technology with a creative work. I am set to work in New York City's diamond district after graduation, combining my tech skills with real-world experience.
        My skills and hobbies are varied: I am into sports like golf, I enjoy playing video games and drawing I like photography and filming. I go to the gym and cook frequently. My favorite movie is "Spider-Man: No Way Home," and my favorite show I can watch repeatedly is the TV show "Friends".   
        Lastly, I have a great family. I have 2 older siblings. One older sister and one older brother. My sister is about to have a baby so our family is expanding and I'm very excited to be an Uncle soon.
