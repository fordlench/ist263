        <p>Hello, my name is Ford Lenchner. I am a student majoring in Information Management at Syracuse University's iSchool. I am exploring the exciting world of technology with a creative work. I am set to work in New York City's diamond district after graduation, combining my tech skills with real-world experience.</p>
        <p>My skills and hobbies are varied: I am into sports like golf, I enjoy playing video games and drawing. I like photography and filming. I go to the gym and cook frequently. My favorite movie is "Spider-Man: No Way Home," and my favorite show I can watch repeatedly is the TV show "Friends".</p>
        <p>Lastly, I have a great family. I have 2 older siblings: one older sister and one older brother. My sister is about to have a baby so our family is expanding, and I'm very excited to be an Uncle soon.</p>
